## Command
A mod for Heroes of Hammerwatch which removes the RNG for items and be able to choose you're own based on the quality it would've originally dropped.

### How do I enable mods?
1. Click the "Profiles" button in the main menu. (It's the button left of the Singleplayer button)

2. Click "Clone this profile" so that you have a secondary profile to use for modding. (Note: Enabling mods on a profile disables achievements for that profile!)

3. Click the "Change mods" button (the button with the cog) for the secondary profile. (You might be asked whether you're sure you want to continue adding mods, click Yes.)

4. Select the mods you want to use and click OK. Mods are now enabled on that profile!

Have fun!
